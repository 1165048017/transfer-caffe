# transfer-caffe

This is a caffe repository for transfer learning. We fork the repository with version ID `29cdee7` from [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and make our modifications. The main modifications are listed as follow:

- Add `mmd layer` described in paper "Learning Transferable Features with Deep Adaptation Networks".
- Add `entropy layer` and `outerproduct layer` described in paper "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Residual Transfer Networks".
- Copy `grl layer` and `messenger.hpp` from repository [Caffe](https://github.com/ddtm/caffe/tree/grl).
- Emit `SOLVER_ITER_CHANGE` message in `solver.cpp` when `iter_` changes.

Data Preparation
---------------
In `data/office/*.txt`, we give the lists of three domains in [Office](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jhoffman/domainadapt/#datasets_code) dataset.

Training Model
---------------

In `models/DAN/amazon_to_webcam`, we give an example model based on Alexnet to show how to transfer from `amazon` to `webcam`. In this model, we insert mmd layers after fc7 and fc8 individually.

The [bvlc\_reference\_caffenet](http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_reference_caffenet.caffemodel) is used as the pre-trained model. If the Office dataset and pre-trained caffemodel is prepared, the example can be run with command "./build/tools/caffe train -solver models/DAN/amazon\_to\_webcam/solver.prototxt -weights models/bvlc\_reference\_caffenet/bvlc\_reference\_caffenet.caffemodel"

Parameter Tuning
---------------
In mmd-layer, parameter `loss_weight` can be tuned to give mmd loss different weights.
